This error occurs when you try to access a property of an object that is null or undefined. This is a common error in JavaScript and React Native, but it can be especially tricky to debug because it doesn't always produce a clear error message.  For example:

```javascript
//Incorrect code
const user = await getUser();
console.log(user.name); //Error if user is null or undefined 
```

The problem is that if the `getUser()` function returns `null` or `undefined`, then trying to access `user.name` will throw an error.
